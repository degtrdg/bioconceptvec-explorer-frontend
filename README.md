# bioconceptvec-explorer-frontend

Goal: develop a tool for exploring and testing biological hypotheses using literature-based concept embeddings, and leverage the tool to discover novel biological insights from the latent knowledge in biomedical literature. 🧠

Project: Use vector operations on BioConceptVec, a collection of embeddings from PubMed abstracts, to make analogies and queries based on existing knowledge. For example, we can use the equation “X - Gene + Drug = Cancer” to find a potential biomarker or target for cancer diagnosis. We also want to validate the results with external evidence from databases and experiments. 🧪

Novelty: We create a tool to explore and test embeddings for biology using BioConceptVec. We also provide ways to check and explain the results with external evidence. 🔬

Impact: The tool unlocks the latent knowledge in biomedical literature and enables novel discoveries in biology. The tool allows researchers to do vector operations on concepts and generate hypotheses beyond term matching or co-occurrence methods. The tool also helps researchers validate and interpret the results with external evidence. 🚀
